# Podcaster

This webapp is a web player for the top 100 podcasts in iTunes. It is built using ReactJS.

The [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file contains comments about the decisions taken while developing this application.

It uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as the CLI to initialize the React application.

The code is formatted using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).


## Running the app (excerpt from the create react app README)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
