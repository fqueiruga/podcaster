### Initial commit

The initial commit contains a bare project created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-appr), the official React CLI. It provides a development environment and tools to generate production builds. 

I did some cleanup and moved some files around, such as moving the App to a components folder.
